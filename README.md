## News
[Mar. 2025] We would like to inform you that the scores for XLSR-Mamba achieves 2nd Rank on the [Speech-DF-Arena leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Speech-Arena-2025/Speech-DF-Arena). 

[Feb. 2025] We release code, checkpoints, and extracted scores for XLSR-Mamba.

## Getting Started
### Setup Environment
You need to create the running environment by [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
First, create and activate the environment:

```bash
conda create -n XLSR_Mamba python=3.10
conda activate XLSR_Mamba
```

Then install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install fairseq:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq.git fairseq_dir
cd fairseq_dir
git checkout a54021305d6b3c
pip install --editable ./
```
### Pretrained XLSR
The pretrained model XLSR can be found at this [link](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fairseq/wav2vec/xlsr2_300m.pt).

We have uploaded the pretrained models of our experiments [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14e6d6z4KTt5ZDPTjh5PJloNzQAxivyEu/view?usp=sharing).

### Datasets
We used the LA partition of ASVspoof 2019 for training and validation, it can be downloaded from [here](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3336).

We used the ASVspoof 2021 database for evaluation. LA can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/4837263#.YnDIinYzZhE), and DF [here](https://zenodo.org/records/4835108#.YnDIb3YzZhE).

We also used the 'In-the-Wild' dataset for evaluation, it can be downloaded from [here](https://deepfake-total.com/in_the_wild).
## Training & Testing on fixed-length input
To train and produce the score for the LA set evaluation, run:
```bash
python main.py --algo 5
```
To train and produce the score for DF set evaluation, run:
```bash
python main.py --algo 3
```
Upon running this command, a new folder will be generated within the 'models' directory, containing the top 5 epochs from this training loop. Additionally, two score files will be created: one for LA and another for DF, both located in the 'Scores' folder.
You can evaluate the score by:
```bash
bash evaluate.sh
```
Please remember to choose the correct score file and the dataset path.

### Pretrained models
We have uploaded the pretrained models of our experiments to 🤗 HugginFace:
